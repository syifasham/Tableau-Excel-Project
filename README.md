# Tableau and Excel Data Analysis Project
Valorant Agents Dataset Dashboard
- Successfully completed a Capstone Project as part of the final course for UPSI KPT CAP Data Analytics Bootcamp
- Conducted data analysis to identify agents/characters with higher win rates, analyze pick rates based on various circumstances (game mode, map, and rank), and evaluate the impact of player skills on win rates
- Overall objective: To help (professional and casual) players/teams to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each agent/character to build effective strategies and improve their chances of winning
- Performed data cleaning and aggregation for a dataset of 5,000 rows using Microsoft Excel, utilizing VLOOKUP, Remove Duplicates, and CONCATENATE function
- Uploaded the database onto Tableau to establish connections between datasets
- Created informative dashboards on Tableau to effectively present data insights and tell a compelling data story
- Extracted key findings from the Tableau visualization, including:
	1. Agent with the highest pick rate average is Reyna, with the value of 0.113 whereas agent with the highest average win rate is Sage, with a value of 0.504. However, there is barely a difference in the average win rates between agents and not much correlation between pick rate and win rate.
	2. In all circumstances, Reyna has the highest pick rate, with a value of 11.35%. Hence, circumstances of the game (map, game mode, and game rank) have impact on the pick rate of the agent. For example, in 'Split' map and 'Spikerush' game mode, Raze scores the highest pick rate (11.7%).
	3. Win rate is highly impacted by the player skills and ranks. For example, Astra has the highest average win rate (51.5%) and kill-death ratio (1.12) when the player's rank is Radiant.
